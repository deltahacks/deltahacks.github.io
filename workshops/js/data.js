		desc: `
A host of technologies are emerging that broadly fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) and are revolutionizing how we design and deliver digital experiences. In this talk, we'll discuss how as AI evolves the conversations we have will give us better opportunities to meet customer needs directly through new connected products that go well beyond smartphones and the AI frameworks currently available within this space.
<br/> <br/>
The second part of the discussion will focus on the traction voice platforms are getting. When we use Voice Interfaces, the interaction is primarily carried out by just speaking and listening. This does not mean that we have to disregard everything we have successfully applied to previous interfaces; we need to adapt our process for the nuances of voice-driven interfaces, including conversational interactions, the lack of a screen and the help we can get from the use of some AI capabilities.  The talk will cover the current ecosystem of voice interfaces and also the trends in each of these platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Microsoft Cortana. We will review some of the self-service APIs and tools that can help us to create new voice-driven capabilities for each platform. And we will use Alexa as main device for live demos and live coding.

We make our robots come alive to double check the software we write and the hardware we design, and we show our work to millions of people each day. Join us in our workshop where we’ll talk about the fascinating revolution going on in the book industry, our experimental api’s, developer motivation, robot motivation, and how we intertwine personalization at a global scale.`,

		desc: `Vision: <br/>
A plant maintenance worker is walking through an operating industrial facility. As they move their AR glasses/phone/tablet is continuously identifying the process equipment around them and displaying a general information for that specific equipment such as name and alarm conditions or required maintenance. The worker notices one piece of equipment (i.e. pump) indicating a problem and requests more detailed information such as time to next maintenance, data from IoT sensors (i.e. vibration, temperature), operating instructions, flow curves, etc). The worker reviews the data and decides to submit a maintenance request to resolve the issue.
<br/><br/>
Problem(s):<br/>
Tracking the physical location and identifying equipment in relation to the users movements. In some instances the discrete pieces of equipment to be tracked and identified are within inches of each other or are physically attached. Achieving a high a level of spatial accuracy or other method for recognizing individual equipment pieces is required.  
<br/><br/>
UI for presenting information in an easy to understand format that does not interfere with the users vision and awareness of their surroundings for safety.

The world of virtual assistants powered by AI is growing — Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Google Assistant, Facebook M to name just a few.  However, did you know it’s quite easy to build your own AI assistant too!  In this workshop you will learn how to create your own AI assistant application using Google Assistant and Dialogflow (natural language processing engine) and integrate it with Google Home.
